# Configuration
Before you can start you need a [AdPage (Tagging)](https://trytagging.com/auth/register) account. Configure
your settings in Magento through **Admin Panel > Stores > Configuration > AdPage > AdPage GTM**.

# Features
The extension has the following configuration options:

- **Enabled**: When this is set to No, the extension does not work.
- **Container HEAD code**: The HEAD code found in the trytagging dashboard. (Excluding <!-- Google Tag Manager -->
<script> and </script>
<!-- End Google Tag Manager -->)
- **Container URL**: The URL you connected in the trytagging dashboard.
- **Debug**: Enable this for additional debugging in a logfile and the browser console.

# Tip: Browser extension
Use the [DataLayer
Checker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/datalayer-checker/ffljdddodmkedhkcjhpmdajhjdbkogke) for Chrome to
easily see what kind of data is sent from Magento to Google Tag Manager.
 
# Tip: CheckoutTester2
When you want to track conversions in your Magento checkout, our extension helps out as well: It adds the relevant information to all your checkout and cart pages. Do you want to know which variables are on the success page? Use the [Yireo CheckoutTester](https://github.com/yireo/Yireo_CheckoutTester2) extension to preview that page and view its HTML source.
